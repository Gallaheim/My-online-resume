    <h3 class="intro">
      <p>My name is Dino! I have a loving wife and cute little 2 year-old boy.
        I am a house-husband/papa/chef/musician/painter/portrait artist/gamer/streamer and a professional Web Developer as well.</p>
      
    <h3 class="intro2">
      <p>I studied Computer Animation in Ateneo de Naga University for 3 years before taking a different path in Culinary Arts.
        I have always been passionate with the arts and all it's forms. I have been drawing since I was a kid, while experimenting
        in the kitchen with various recipes including Oregano Scrambled Eggs (it tastes better than it sounds).
      </p>
      
    <h3 class="intro3">
      <p>As an avid fan of gaming, whether its board games or video games, I've always loved to compete and have fun in any game I play.
        How did I get from drawing, to cooking, and finally to.. coding? Well, let's just say I have found a new curiosity in coding.
        Wondering what web pages, applications, and games look like behind the curtain. Trying to imagine the cogs and mechanisms running
        beneath the surface that make for our work, leisure, and entertainment in our daily lives.
